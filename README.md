# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The main purpose of this analysis is looking at data from many different Kickstarter campaigns with the intention of finding any trends or information that would help launch a successful Kickstarter campaign for a Play or Theater production. The client, Louise, has launched a Kickstarter for her play, *Fever*, and is near her goal, but she would still like to know how different campaigns have faired based on their launch date and financial goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### The first relationship that was analysised was between the outcomes for a theater kickstarter and their launch date. The easiest way to get all of the data we want to analysis in the same place is to create a pivot table. Creating a pivot table that sorts the outcomes based on each month that can also be filtered by category and year will get all the data we care about in one place. The most challeneging part of this section of the analysis for me was making sure that the pivot table displayed all the appropriate information in the right places by playing around wih the pivot table fields. At this point creating a line graph that uses number of campaigns as its y axis and month as its x axis will be our best way to visualize any trends that would be present. Setting up a graph with those axies gives us [this graph]()

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
